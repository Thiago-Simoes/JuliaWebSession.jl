# JuliaWebSession.jl
Pure Julia package to easily manage Sessions using Genie.jl.

> ### Why did I create this package if GenieSession exists?
> I cannot use GenieSession and there is almost no documentation teaching how to use it. So this package make this easy and fast.

I'm a student with limited experience, I did my best, but the first version was coded in just one day, so that's a package under development and prabably with problems and certainly with potential improvements. Saw something to fix or improve? Tell me.

The main purpose of this package is to make web development easier for Julia, this language has a LOT of potential. By facilitating development, we can grow the community and
improve technologies
